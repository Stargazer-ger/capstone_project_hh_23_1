__!!! You will get a lot of feedback in this meeting, take notes!!!__ 
* This entails that you note down key discussion points in order to keep track of ideas within the team and talk with the stakeholders. 
* Ensure that you take ~1 day to plan your execution after a shallow dive of the data to help you brainstorm and not get tunnel visioned. Document this process as well.
