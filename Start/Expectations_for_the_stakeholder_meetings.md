# __Expectations for the stakeholder meetings__
Deliverable: A slide presentation (google/powerpoint/keynote)
### Content:
* Why?
  * Introduction to topic
    - As a group interested in education, we observe the negative effects of the pandemic on German educational levels. We see a decline in morale, weakened skills, developmental deficits, and a weakening of social skills. Furthermore, school closures disproportionately impacted certain communities, resulting in distributing unequal access to education.
    - Observations were made during tutoring (Znati).
  * Problem
    - Grades have gotten worse.
  * Target group/stakeholder
    - Kultus-, (Bildungs)ministerien
    - Bildungs- und Gesundheitspolitik i. A.?
* What?
  * Data catalog
    * Number of data sets
      - 'Abiturnoten im Ländervergleich'/ Abitur grades by states comparison von der Kultusministerkonferenz (13 Datensätze von 2010-2022)
      - Statistisches Bundesamt: 'graduation_gender.csv' (1 dataset, graduation numbers by states and gender)
    * Number of columns and rows
    * Data model (ER-diagram)
    * Column definitions
    * Data types (int, float etc.)
    * Dimensions/Measures
      - Dimensions: years, states, gender, educational level
      - measures: grades (nur Abitur), Dropout rate, number of graduates
    * Data Quality (Outliers, null values etc.)
  * Objective
    * Questions
      1. How were the grades before 2019, are there any consistencies in the grades or any increase or decrease?
      2. How is the 2020 grades till date?
      3. Classification by gender, state, education lecel? Who is more affected?
      4. impact on dropout rate since Covid?
      5. Development of the number of graduations through time
      6. Comparison of different education levels by graduation
    * Hypotheses
      1. Grades became worse during the covid19 pandemic
      2. There is a positive correlation between the total number of examinations conducted and the number of examinations passed.
      3. There is a difference in the pass rate between states in the eastern part of Germany (former East Germany) and states in the western part of Germany (former West Germany).
      4. The number of students who scored a grade of 1.0 varies significantly across different German federal states.
      5. The percentage of students scoring high grades (e.g., 1.0 to 1.5) is higher in certain states compared to others.
      6. There is a correlation between the average grades and the size of the student population in each German federal state.

    * Assumptions
  * Deliverables
    * Project scope (in/out)
    * Minimum viable product (MVP) 
      - Analysis of grades in Germany (Abitur)
      - Questions 1-6 should be possible to answer
* How? - Project Management
    * Team
      * Relative skill ranking of each team member

__!!! You will get a lot of feedback in this meeting, take notes!!!__ 
* This entails that you note down key discussion points in order to keep track of ideas within the team and talk with the stakeholders. 
* Ensure that you take ~1 day to plan your execution after a shallow dive of the data to help you brainstorm and not get tunnel visioned. Document this process as well.
